# Citi Bike Ride Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Citi Bike Ride Analysis Challenge! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, you are embarking on a journey to leverage data insights to improve and publicize the largest bike-sharing program in the United States.

This repository contains resources and guidelines to help you tackle your first task on the job: building a set of data reports to address questions from city officials and stakeholders.

## Data Source
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has been collecting comprehensive data on bike rides throughout New York City. This data is regularly updated and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. The dataset includes information such as ride duration, start and end stations, user types, and more.

## Objective
Create insightful reports and visualizations that provide answers to questions raised by city officials and stakeholders. These reports will help in publicizing the program and identifying areas for improvement.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Citi Bike Ride Analysis Challenge, follow these steps:
1. **Explore the Data**: I familiarized myself with the datasets located in the data directory. I've thoroughly reviewed Citi Bike's provided documentation to grasp the dataset's structure and variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: I have processed the data as needed to clean and prepare it for analysis. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and concatenating large sets of data using Python and Pandas.
3. **Analysis and Reporting**: Utilizing Tableau I created multiple visualizations to analyze the data, generate insights and communicated my findings effectively.
4. **Comparison Analysis**: For this challenge, I have chosen to analyze the data for August 2022 and August 2023 to compare and identify changes over time.
5. **Documentation**: Document your analysis process, including any assumptions made, challenges encountered, and insights gained to be shared with city officials and stakeholders to inform decision-making.

## Resources
**Citi Bike Data**: Official webpage for accessing Citi Bike dataset.

**Python & Pandas**: To clean and concatenate the data.

**Tableau**: To create visualizations, dashboards and a story to be presented to the Citi Bike stakeholders.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the comparative analysis between August 2022 and August 2023 reveals several notable trends within the New York Citi Bike program:

1. **Increase in Ride Volume**: There has been a noticeable uptick in the number of Citi Bike rides between 2022 and 2023. This surge indicates a growing popularity and acceptance of bike-sharing as a convenient mode of transportation within the city.
2. **Shift towards Membership**: Over this period, there's been a discernible shift in rider demographics, with more individuals opting for membership rather than casual rides. This transition suggests an increasing inclination towards long-term commitment and utilization of the Citi Bike service among riders.
3. **Peak Riding Hours**: Analysis of ride patterns unveils that the most popular time to utilize Citi Bikes is between 5-6 PM. This peak hour signifies a significant portion of riders utilizing the bikes, likely attributed to commuting purposes or recreational activities during the evening hours.

These insights offer valuable implications for the New York Citi Bike program, informing strategies to accommodate the growing demand, optimize membership offerings, and enhance service accessibility during peak hours. By leveraging these findings, city officials and stakeholders can make informed decisions to further strengthen and promote the Citi Bike initiative, ensuring its continued success in serving the transportation needs of New Yorkers.
